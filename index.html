            <h2>Take Control of the Problems Around You!</h2>
            <p>With devDesk, issue submission forms are streamlined to get the
            maximum amount of information from the end user without overwhelming
            them. Clearly defined sections and labels make sure the end user
            gets you the information you need to solve any problem imaginable!</p>

          <h2>Don't let issues slip through the cracks!</h2>
          <p>With email and slack alerts, you will never forget an open ticket.
          Simple notifcations keep you abreast of any changes to the ticket
          in real time. Mark a ticket with three different levels of severity
          to make things easy to sort and view from above.</p>

          <h2>End User Notifcations keep everyone happy!</h2>
          <p>Once a ticket is checked out by you, the end user is automatically
          notified that their problems will soon be at an end! Cut out the
          middle man of sending an email to let the user know you are on their
          problem with notifcations on their slack or email with a click of
          a button.</p>

          <p>After years of using Jira, devDesk was a breath of fresh air!
          I love that the automatic notifcations are stopping my users
          from interupting me at my desk to see if I have started on their
          problem. It gives me plenty of breathing room to focus on the task at hand!</p>

          <p>I had a nightmare time trying to get users to submit enough
          information in their tickets. Each ticket I worked on had a
          massive back and forth of emails just for me to get basic information,
          but with devDesk's forms, the users know EXACTLY what information we need!</p>

          <p>I cannot express how many times the notifcations have saved my tail.
          I have issues keeping everything organized and several dropped balls
          were caught thanks to the severity system devDesk uses. My day to day
          is chaotic and it gives me great piece of mind to know devDesk is on
          my side when I am trying to remember what still needs to be done!</p>
