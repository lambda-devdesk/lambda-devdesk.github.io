        <h2>A dream coded from nightmares!</h2>
        <p>The designers of devDesk have worked with countless ticketing programs
        before even before attending Lambda School. Late nights at previous jobs
        fighting with these programs and problems gave us a clear path, a
        streamlined system designed to work with you rather than against you.</p>
        <p>Our team started devDesk in the early summer days of 2019. With a
        small team of Lambda hardened coders, we pushed through each wall in
        front of us and made something to be proud of, something truly
        special, and we think you will think so too.</p>

        <h2>By Lambda students, for Lambda students!</h2>
        <p>The best part of devDesk is the love that goes into the lines
        of code. Every line has been written by someone that has walked the same
        path as those that will use it. We all share in the experience of
        Lambda School, making it simple to spot the pitfalls and fill them
        up with features that counter every issue we personally encountered
        in our time at Lambda. When you are using devDesk, you are standing
        on the top of the same mountain countless others have climbed!</p>
